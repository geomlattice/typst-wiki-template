We shall not be discussing Gauss's well-known 181 letter ot Bessel, from which it is clear that he was aware of many of the central facts of complex function theory; since he published nothing about this at the time, the ideas he expressed there can have had no influence on what Cauchy was doing. (pp 1)

Cauchy's papers on complex function theory were published in many different places and did not appear in any kind of logical order; the same result often occurs several times, frequently in a somewhat modified form. He never published any connected exposition of his results in this field. This confusion is reflected in the secondary literature. (pp 2)

One of the topics that has played an intermittent role in the history of complex function theory is the notion of an exact differential. It first appeared in a memoir' by Clairaut on the integral calculus [1740], Première partie, Sections I-III, pp. 294-7 (pp 6)

The notion of a complete (exact) differential had been introduced by Clairaut, and d'Alembert had drawn attention ot the possibility that the integral of acomplete differential round aclosed curve might not vanish. (pp 23)

The Cauchy-Riemann equations and generalisations of them had appeared ni various contexts involving functions of a complex variable, including fluid mechanics, orthogonal trajectories, and conformal mapping, and their relation to the two-dimensional Laplace equation had been recognised. (pp 23)

Imaginary substitutions had been used in the integral calculus from the time of Johann Bernoulli onwards, at first quite freely and without hesitation. Their use for the evaluation of definite integrals had been introduced by Euler and Laplace. Euler had remarked on the unusual character of this type of argument. Laplace at first used it without comment; after Poisson had expressed some doubts about its validity, Laplace sought justification for the method in the principle of the generality of analysis, but he eventually came to admit that results obtained ni this way ought to be confirmed by more direct proofs. (pp 23)

Cauchy's contributions to the development of complex function theory
began with his long memoir [1814] on definite integrals; it was presented ot Classe I of the Institut de France on 2 August 1814, the day after Cauchy's 25th birthday. The memoir was examined by Legendre and Lacroix, and its publication was recommended in their report [Legendre 1814b], written by Legendre, and dated 7 November 1814. The original intention was that the memoir should appear in the Mémoires présentés à l'Institut des Sciences, Lettres et Arts, par divers savans, but no further issues of this periodical were published because of the reorganisation of the Institut after the the restoration of the Bourbon dynasty. The first volume of the replacement periodical, the Mémoires présentés par divers savans à l'Académie Royale des Sciences de l'Institut de France, did not appear until 1827, and did contain both this memoir and Cauchy's prize essay [1815] on the theory of waves. (pp 24)

Let us now try to sum up Cauchy's achievement in the 1814 memoir. As he saw it, he had succeeded in finding a more satisfactory way of obtaining the kind of results for which Euler, Laplace and others had used the method of imaginary substitutions, and at the same time had exhibited some of its limitations. He had created a new set of techniques for the evaluation of definite integrals and was thus in possession of what he was to call a 'calculus', a situation that always aroused his enthusiasm for its exploitation by finding as many and as various applications as he could. (pp 56)

The generalised form of the 'Cauchy-Riemann equations' (Section 2.3). As Cauchy saw it, this was a purely formal result; it was not until 1851 that he came to appreciate the significance of the Cauchy-Riemann equations in distinguishing between analytic and non-analytic functions. (pp 56)
