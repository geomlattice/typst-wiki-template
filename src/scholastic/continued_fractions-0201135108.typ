- began in its explicit form in the latter decades of the 16th century with a paper by Bombelli written when the concepts and notations of algebra were first being laid down in Italy and France. Such expressions play a natural role in connection with the iterated application of the Euclidean algorithm and some mathematical historians have claimed to have found similar usages in Hindu or even Greek mathematics. Infinite continued fractions were first considered by Lord Brouncker, first president of the Royal Society. The earliest continued fractions had whole numbers as their entries and were applied to the rational approximation of various algebraic numbers and of IT. The use of continued fractions as an important tool in number theory began with 17th century results of Schwenter, Huygens, and Wallis and came to maturity with the work of Euler in 1737 and the subsequent use of continued fractions as a number theoretic tool by Lagrange, Legendre, Gauss, Galois, and their successors. Continued fraction expan- sions involving functions of a complex variable rather than simply num- bers were introduced by Euler and became an important tool in the approximation of special classes of analytic functions in the work of Euler, Lambert, and Lagrange. A particularly influential direction of study was the expansions in continued fractions introduced by Gauss in 1813 for ratios of hypergeometric functions, one of the earliest contexts in which orthogonal polynomials made their appearance. (pp xv-xvi)

- The central position of the study of continued fractions in the difice of classical 19th century analysis is attested to by the long list of major analysts who treated problems in this area, including names like Laplace, Legendre, Jacobi, Eisenstein, Heine, Laguerre, Riemann, Stieltjes, Tchebycheff, Frobenius, and Poincare. The conceptual consequences of these investigations were far-reaching, particularly in the work of Stieltjes where they led to such far-reaching developments as the study of the moment problem (with all its eventual impact on the development of twentieth-century functional analysis), the definition and study of the Stieltjes integral, the beginnings of the systematic study of convergence of sequences of holomorphic functions (the Stieltjes-Vitali theorem) and the application of the early machinery of spectral theory for self-adjoint operators in Hilbert space to the moment problem by Hilbert and his school. Asymptotic expansions seem to have found an early origin in the work of Poincare and Stieltjes on the use of continued fraction expansions in connection with divergent series. (pp xvi)

- Beginning in the area of statistical mechanics and solid state physics (but with a rapid extension to other areas of theoretical physics), techniques elaborated by Frobenius and Pade in the late nine- teenth century to obtain expansions of analytic functions in the complex plane in terms of rational functions given as approximants of continued fractions, have become a major computational tool under the general name of Pade approximants. The large-scale nature of the resulting computa- tional enterprise has given a renewed impetus to the whole field of study, and in particular has made the present volume very timely (pp xvii)
