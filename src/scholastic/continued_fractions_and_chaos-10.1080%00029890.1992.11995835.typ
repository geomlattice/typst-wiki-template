- The theory of continued fractions goes back at least to c. A.D. 500 to the work of Aryabhata, and possibly as far back as c. 300 B.c. to Euclid. The theory of chaotic dynamical systems is relatively recent, going back only to the work of Poincare [1899] and Birkhoff [1932]. The foundations of the theory of continued fractions, as we know it now, are well established due to the work of Euler, Lagrange, Gauss, and others, while the foundations of chaotic dynamical systems are still evolving. This paper will use the well-established theory of simple continued fractions to explore some current results of the theory of chaotic dynamical systems. (pg 2)

- The Gauss Map. We begin with the classical method for finding the continued fraction representation of a number y. (pg 3)

- we see that the continued fraction is generated as a byproduct of the iteration of the Gauss map. Thus we expect that any classical results on continued fractions will have implications for the dynamics of the Gauss map. (pg 3)

- Note that the jump discontinuities occuring at $x = frac(1,n)$ (for each integer n) may all be removed by mapping onto the circle with the transformation
